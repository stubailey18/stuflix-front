# StuFlix (Front)

This is the React front-end of an app for querying the [Open Movie Database] (https://www.omdbapi.com/). I built a version of it whilst teaching a React course. The app exploits React's useReducer hook to manage user state though it's not really necessary to do so given the app's size. 

You can see the app in action [here](https://stubailey18.com/stuflix). The code for the back-end part of the app is accessible [here](https://github.com/stubailey18/stuflix-back).
